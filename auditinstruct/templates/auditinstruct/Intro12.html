    <p><strong><i>(The following examples illustrate the net earnings computation. Because the examples merely illustrate the earnings
        computation, you should not view the hypothetical actions as indicative of the best thing for you to do.)</i></strong></p>

    <div>Example 2:</div>
    <p></p>

    <p>Suppose the true quantity of goods is 59 croissants and 41 muffins, as in example 1, but the bill of lading
    reports an inflated count of 79 croissants. Suppose also that you decide to sample 15 items of which 8 are
    croissants, so the sample's estimate is 53 croissants and 47 muffins in the shipment. In this case, because
    the count of 79 croissants is outside the previously described range of 43-63 croissants, the shipment is
    automatically rejected. Because your sampling results lead you to reject an incorrect shipment, your earnings
    computation for this round will again be 50 (revenue) â€“ 15 (sampling cost) = 35 dollars, as in example 1.</p>
